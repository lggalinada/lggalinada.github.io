        <h3>Welcome to Desolve</h3>
        <p>So what is Desolve? The short answer is that it comes from the combination of design and evolve, something we hope we're doing constantly. A slightly longer version is that we're a collection of photographers, designers, and creatives who enjoy urban photography. During our travels around the country, we take time to document the cities we love. You'll also occasionally find articles on design, our thoughts on the latest trends, and the odd posting on photography.</p>

        <h3>So... what aren't we?</h3>
        <p>Professional photographers, for one. Please keep in mind that we're strictly amateur photographers. We submit these galleries out of love and creative expression. We're not likely to remember the settings we took the picture at, or even what lens we had. We also don't go through a submittal and approval process, so if you're interested, drop us a line and tell us what you have in mind.</p>

        <h3>Upcoming Cities</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>San Antonio Jan 033</li>
          <li>Salt Lake City Jan 23</li>
          <li>Grand Rapids March 13</li>
          <li>Charleston April 66</li>
          <li>San Francisco June 05</li>
          <li>Seattle July 16</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <p>We're betting you do too. Welcome to our site, a growing collection of galleries taken by a small group of passionate urban photographers. Visit our galleries, buy some of our prints, or drop us a line. While you're at it, feel free to submit a gallery of your own. Welcome.</p>

        <h3>Photographers Rights</h3>
        <p>Due to the heightened security concerns around the country, it has become common to find photographers routinely challenged when taking pictures in public places. With that in mind, we've invited Jaren in a free forum as noted when she spoke to us presents "Photographers' Rights in a Post 9/11 World".</p>
        <p>Shea will discuss your rights when taking photos in a public space. Following talk will have open forum where you can ask questions, compare experiences, and become better informed as to what your responsibilities are as amateur photographers.</p>
        <p>The forum will be held at the Cheek-Chastain Gallery, 227 West 29th Street in Manhattan on March 10th as part of their "Engage" lecture series.</p>
